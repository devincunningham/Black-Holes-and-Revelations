# Black Holes and Revelations
Exploration into machine learning, dimensional reduction, and other data analysis tools to discover astronomical objects with SDSS.

### Primary Goals:
Writing a general function which utilizes machine learning techniques to help compile astronomical candidates based on an itial training set of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

### Useful Resources:

## Waver:
This tool lets you quickly check visually in python whether an astronomical object has observation data in the Very Large Array, SDSS, or the Chandra Source Catalog.
